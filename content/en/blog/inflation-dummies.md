Peter buys a house for $100.

10time passes and Peter sells his home for $200.

2time later he decides he wants to buy the same house back but now the house costs $210.

However Peter has only $160 after paying $40 capital gain taxes.

He lost $50 buying power, and therefore is poorer.

Peter was hedging inflation with real estate.
